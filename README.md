# [Rancid Tomatillos](https://github.com/sarahcatherine311/rancid-tomatillos)


### Abstract:
This is an interactive web-based application that was developed to make the user's experience viewing popular movies easy. The user is presented with a list of popular movie posters that they are able to click to view further details as well as a trailer for the movie. The user is also able to use our Search feature to find a specific movie as well as filter all the movies from highest rating to lowest rating


### Feature Spotlight
We successfully implemented Router as well as a fully functionable search bar into our application


### Installation Instructions:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to where you would like to store the repositorie. 
3. Using the `SSH` key, paste `git clone git@github.com:sarahcatherine311/rancid-tomatillos.git` into your terminal.
4. `cd` into the server's repository on your local machine and run `npm install` or `npm i` to install project dependencies.
6. Open the app's Github repo: https://github.com/sarahcatherine311/rancid-tomatillos
7. In a new tab within your terminal, paste `git clone git@github.com:sarahcatherine311/rancid-tomatillos.git` to clone using the `SSH` key. 
8. `cd` into the app's repository on your local machine and run `npm install` or `npm i` to install project dependencies.
9. Run `npm start` to launch this API's server.
11. `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server

### Context:


This project was completed in the 3 module of the Turing front-end software engineering program. We were required to synthesize technical information learned thus in the program, in addition to project management skills to create a fully functioning site. This project required additional research to implement new technologies.

### Learning Goals:

- Use React to succesfully manipulate state and props
- Use Router as well as Cypress testing to make a fully functional web application
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Implement ES6 classes with a complex data model
- Make network requests using the fetch API to retrieve and post data to a local server
- Create a user interface that is easy to use, clearly displays information, and follows best practices for accessibility


### Technologies Used:
- React.js
- Cypress
- Router.js
- Fetch API
- Webpack module bundler
- Git/GitHub/ProjectBoard
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML


### Wins + Challenges:


#### Wins

-Team: succesfully being able to pivot from making the web based on state to changing it to deal with url path was definitely the biggest win!

#### Challenges:

-Team: Id say the biggest challenge also just had to be refactoring code to deal with url path rather than conditional rendering dealing with state
