# [Rancid Tomatillos](https://github.com/sarahcatherine311/rancid-tomatillos)


### Abstract:
This is an interactive web-based application that was developed to make the user's experience viewing popular movies easy. The user is presented with a list of popular movie posters that they are able to click to view further details as well as a trailer for the movie. The user is also able to use our Search feature to find a specific movie and filter all the movies by their rating.


### Feature Spotlight
We successfully implemented React Router into our application


### Installation Instructions:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to where you would like to store the repositorie. 
1. Open the app's Github repo: https://github.com/sarahcatherine311/rancid-tomatillos
1. In a new tab within your terminal, paste `git clone git@github.com:sarahcatherine311/rancid-tomatillos.git` to clone using the `SSH` key. 
1. `cd` into the app's repository on your local machine and run `npm install` or `npm i` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` to launch this API's server.
1. `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server

### Context:

This project was completed in the 3rd module of Turing School of Software & Design's front-end software engineering program. We were required to synthesize technical information learned in the program, in addition to project management skills to create a fully functioning site. This project required additional research to implement new technologies.

### Learning Goals:

- Use React to succesfully manipulate state and props
- Use Router as well as Cypress testing to make a fully functional web application
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Implement ES6 classes with a complex data model
- Make network requests using the fetch API to retrieve and post data to a local server
- Create a user interface that is easy to use, clearly displays information, and follows best practices for accessibility


### Technologies Used:
- React.js
- Cypress
- Router.js
- Fetch API
- Webpack module bundler
- Git/GitHub/ProjectBoard
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML


### Wins + Challenges:


#### Wins

- Succesfully being able to pivot from making the web based on state to changing it to deal with url path was definitely the biggest win!

#### Challenges:

- The biggest challenge we faced was refactoring code using Router rather than conditional rendering by the state.
